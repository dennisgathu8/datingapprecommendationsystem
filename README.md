Simply sing data-driven techniques to provide personalized matchmaking suggestions to individuals seeking partners through online dating platforms. These recommendations are based on various factors and preferences, aiming to increase the likelihood of successful and compatible matches.

We started by considering the interests or hobbies of both users listed in their profiles. Each shared interest contributes 1 point to the compatibility score. The more shared interests they have, the higher their compatibility score will be. For example, if both users enjoy travelling, that’s a shared interest and adds a point to their score. 
Age can play a significant role in compatibility. We calculated a score based on the age difference between the two users. If the age difference is small (within ten years), they receive a higher score. However, if the age difference is large, the score starts decreasing. It ensures that users with similar ages are more likely to have a higher match score.
User engagement with the app, as measured by their swiping history (e.g., the number of likes or dislikes they’ve given), is considered. A higher swiping history indicates more active use of the app to find a partner and contributes to a higher score. It encourages matchmaking with users who are actively engaged in the dating process.
The type of relationship each user is looking for (e.g., long-term relationship, marriage) is also used to calculate the match score. If both users are seeking the same type of relationship, they receive a point. This score reflects the compatibility of their relationship goals.
The final compatibility score is calculated by summing up the individual scores from the previous steps. A higher total score suggests a better potential match, while a lower score indicates a less compatible match.

The last function defined is responsible for generating recommendations. It takes two sets of user profiles as input, one for males and one for females, and returns a list of recommended matches.
It iterates through each male user profile one by one. For each male profile, it searches through the female profiles to find the best potential match. It initially sets best_match to None and best_score to a negative value to ensure that the first female profile encountered becomes the initial best match.
As the code iterates through female profiles, it calculates the match score for each male-female profile pair and compares it to the previous best score. If the new score is higher, it updates the best_match and best_score with the current female profile and score.
Once the best match is found for a male profile, it is stored as a recommendation in the recommendations list, along with the male and female profiles involved in the match and the match score.
After generating recommendations for all male profiles, the code sorts the recommendations based on the match score in descending order. It ensures that the highest-scoring recommendations appear at the top.
Finally, it prints out the top recommendations, including information about the male and female profiles and their match scores.
